# Pokedex

This project consists of the creation of a web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main objective is to allow users to visualize and select a Pokémon through a filter, using information obtained from an API.

The structure of the project is divided into three main parts:

HTML: This will be used to define the structure of the web page. This includes the creation of elements such as buttons, search fields and containers to display the information of the selected Pokémon.

CSS: It will be used to style and design the web page. This involves defining colors, fonts, element layout and any other visual properties needed to enhance the appearance of the site.

JavaScript: It will be used for the interactive functionality of the page. This involves event handling, communicating with the API to get data about the Pokémon, and dynamically updating the UI in response to user actions.

The workflow for this project would be as follows:

Initial setup: HTML, CSS and JavaScript files will be set up, as well as the integration of the API that provides the Pokémon data.

Interface design: We will define how the web page will look, including the layout of the elements and the visual style.

Implementation of the filter functionality: JavaScript code will be written to allow users to filter Pokémon by certain criteria, such as type, generation or name.

Display of the selected Pokémon's information: Logic will be developed to display the details of the selected Pokémon on the web page, such as its name, type, statistics and an image.

Testing and debugging: The web page will be tested in different browsers and devices to ensure its correct functioning. Bugs will be corrected and performance will be optimized as needed.

Deployment: Once the project is completed and tested, the website will be published on a server to be publicly available.

This project will not only provide an interactive and entertaining experience for users, but will also serve as an opportunity to apply and improve web development skills using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
